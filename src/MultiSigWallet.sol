                                Multi-Signature Wallet
Problem Description:
Develop a multi-signature wallet smart contract using Solidity. The contract should allow multiple
owners to collectively control the funds in the wallet. The key features include:
​
​
​
A wallet with multiple owners, each having their own private key.
A specified number of owners (threshold) is required to approve and execute a transaction.
Owners can submit, approve, and cancel transactions.
Requirements:
● Implement the smart contract in Solidity.
● Use appropriate data structures to manage owners and transactions.
● Include proper access controls and security measures.
● Ensure efficient handling of transactions and gas optimization.
